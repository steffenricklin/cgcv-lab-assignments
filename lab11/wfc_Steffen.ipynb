    "If you're into game design (or maybe someting more exotic, like computer-generated art), you may have needed to generate large random patterns. Maybe because you want infinite levels, or because you're just making randomly-generated levels for your cool roguelike, or you're ~~lazy~~ pressed for time and would like some computer help to generate textures.\n",

    "A typical technique is to create these using [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise). Minecraft, for instance, uses a variant of it to generate its sprawling worlds. But Perlin noise is only appropriate if you don't have very strong constraints between the elements of your generated structure. For instance, if you're generating 2D platformer levels, you'll want ladders to always start and finish at platforms. You could post-process your random levels to do that, but it may become very tricky if your constraints are hard to tack onto a generated thing! \n",

    "## Going further\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different optimizations and variants of WFC exist. I'll talk about two important aspects that are present in many real-life WFC implementations. See the references for more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "WFC almost always succeeds with the tileset I gave here. If you mess with the tileset a little, however, you'll realize that it's not always the case. Keeping only the four \"T\" tiles, for instance, results in a much lower success rate, as WFC runs into contradictions and quits. (You should still be able to get something out if you run WFC ~10 times).\n",
    "\n",
    "One option to deal with that is to just keep retrying, which can trivially be implemented on top of this solution. A more sophisticated option is to implement _backtracking_: when we hit a contradiction, we go back to a previous state and try again. This allows us to keep some of the already computed output image, while hopefully throwing out enough bad choices to get rid of the contradictory situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating from images\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting aspect of the original WFC which I haven't talked about at all is the ability to automatically extract tiles from images. This is how many of the examples on WFC's impressive readme page are implemented. The key idea is to extract all 3x3 pixel blobs (or any other size, but it has to be kept relatively small) from the original image, determine their weights and which can be placed next to which, and then run this tiled algorithm.\n",
