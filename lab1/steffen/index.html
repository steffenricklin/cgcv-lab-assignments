      <h3>Changes</h3>
      <p>The following 10+ changes, next to the usual ones from the tutorial, were applied to the LEGO microgame:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>added a wall at the starting area to not get killed in the starting area. So the player has a safe zone</li>
        <li>added a sound for the pig on the island</li>
        <li>added a platform for easier access to the island</li>
        <li>Made the wizard on the island speak in the form of a speech bubble that warns the player of the dangerous pig.</li>
        <li>Added a collectible fruit to the tree on the island. With this the player must visit the island in order to win (winning condition pick up all collectibles).</li>
        <li>Connected another island close to the win-block with a platform which can be moved by the player</li>
        <li>on the new island, we planted 3 cacti and made them hazardous</li>
        <li>on the new island, we added a collectible crab</li>
        <li>added a giraffe that looks at the player and plays a sound when the button 'F' is pressed</li>
        <li>added a detonation side that can be activated from the new island</li>
      </ol>
