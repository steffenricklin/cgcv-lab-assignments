## Lab 2

This lab assignment was a Creators Kit Unity Tutorial.


### Created game 

We encoutered the same error when building for WebGL as others have reported in Discord: 
The build cannot be completed unless the colour space is changed to gamma. Therefore, the colours are changed in the here uploaded version.
