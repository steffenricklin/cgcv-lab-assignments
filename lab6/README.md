## Lab 6

The task was to create a Mandelbrot shader.

The code of our **main submission** can be inspected following [this link](https://github.com/steffenricklin/cgcv-lab-assignments/lab6/MainSubmission/).
This includes the c# and shader scripts of exercise 1 and exercise 2 of which the latter scripts are named _Mandelbrot.cs_ and _Mandelbrot.compute_.
That directory also contains the screenshots shown below as well as a **Windows Build** to run it.

As a **bonus** we also created a Mandelbrot Shader without using the computeShader. That bonus can be found following [this link](https://github.com/steffenricklin/cgcv-lab-assignments/blob/main/lab6/RonScripts).
The directy of the bonus also includes the c# and shader scripts, screenshots as well as a **MacOS Build**.

We have a third implementation that uses the mouse to zoom in and out whereas the main submission uses the WASD-keys to move and the + and - keys to zoom.
In ComputeShader you can find both a MacOS build and the corresponding c# and shader script.
